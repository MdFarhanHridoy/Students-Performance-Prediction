# Students-Performance-Prediction
The "Students Performance in Exams" project endeavors to enhance educational outcomes by predicting students' performance based on various factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, math score, reading score, writing score etc. The goal is to create a prediction model that will help teachers and educational institutions spot kids who could be performing below expectations so that they can provide timely support and intervention. This initiative aims to enhance instructional tactics and students' overall learning experience by utilizing machine learning algorithms. This initiative's goal is to provide educators and other educational stakeholders with insightful knowledge that will enable them to take a proactive approach to student performance and implement individualized learning interventions.
